# Interview Test
### by _The Tinkering Society_

_Inspired by [Aztec Network](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/interview-test)'s Interview Test_

The purpose of this interview test is to provide applicants with an expedited route towards showcasing their skills and talking with our team. It is completely optional, and you may apply to any of our roles by simply sending your resume per the note at the bottom of this page.

## Developers

#### Option 1

Write something like a UniV2 pool (no fork, from scratch) with a minimum set of methods like SwapWithExactInput and SwapWithExactOutput (no ETH, just 2 ERC20 and no LP) or whatever minimal and meaningful component you like (just avoid trivial things like ERC20s) in 2 languages: Solidity and a model in Python, R, or a language of your choice.

Then do some equivalence checking.

#### Option 2

Write a contract that interacts with other deployed contracts on Mainnet / Testnet / L2s and does something meaningful.

You will write it in a Hardhat / Foundry / (whatever you prefer) framework that forks Mainnet or a Testnet.

#### Option 3

Feeling creative? Submit a proposal for your own challenge. For this option, please first outline the challenge and let us know before investing time in your solution.

## Analysts

Introduce an innovative DeFi protocol to us. This should be a high-level (single page) overview of why you think the design is elegant, either from a product-market fit perspective or from a tokenomics standpoint. We may extend this challenge into a paid project, so pick an interesting protocol you would like to research and understand to an even deeper degree.

## Metrics & Evaluation

- Completeness
- Correctness
- Clarity and Simplicity
- Creativity
- Depth of Research

Since we are aware these are open tasks and we respect candidates' time we **do not** encourage candidates to spend > 8 hours on this task.

Candidates that really want to stand out can work on a great solution in two steps: first, submit a minimal solution + your plans to extend it.

If you pass, you will enter the interview process and you'll be given more time to improve the solution and discuss it.

Alternatively, you can go for the standard interview process path that won't be centered around your solution. To simply submit your resume, shoot us an email at **info@tinkeringsociety.xyz**
